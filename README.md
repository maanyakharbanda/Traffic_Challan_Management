# Traffic_Challan_Management_System
📌 Project Overview
The Traffic Challan Management System is designed to efficiently manage and analyze traffic violation data. This system enables real-time storage and retrieval of challan details, including the reason for the violation, time and location, vehicle information, and challan status.

Through data analysis, we identified major traffic violations and high-risk areas where challans are frequently issued. The project seamlessly integrates database management, data analysis, and user-friendly interface development.

This project helped us to apply all the concepts learned throughout the semester, from envisioning and planning to execution from scratch.

🔥 Features

✔️ Stores detailed data of all traffic challans.

✔️ Captures reasons behind each challan.

✔️ Records exact time and location of violations.

✔️ Maintains information about the vehicle and offender.

✔️ Tracks challan payment and status.

✔️ Provides graphical analysis of violations, highlighting common offenses and peak violation locations.
